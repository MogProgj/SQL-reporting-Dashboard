# Architecture Decision Records

> Public build started on 2026-03-01.

## ADR 001: Postgres + simple seed script

**Context:** The project needs a relational database with realistic-looking data
for local development and demos.

**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL (via Docker) with a hand-written seed script
(`seed/seed.sql`) that creates tables and inserts a small number of rows.

**Consequences:**
- Anyone with Docker can spin up the database in seconds.
- The seed script is easy to read and extend.
- No ORM or migration tool is required at this stage.

## ADR 002: Streamlit for fast reporting UI

**Context:** The dashboard needs a web UI that can render KPIs, tables, and
charts with minimal front-end code.

**Decision:** Use Streamlit as the presentation layer. SQL stays in plain `.sql`
files or inline strings; Streamlit renders the results.

**Consequences:**
- Very fast to iterate on new reports.
- No REST API or SPA framework needed for the MVP.
- Streamlit's caching (`@st.cache_data`) keeps page loads snappy.
